<p>I'm a <a href="http://www.southampton.ac.uk/oes/postgraduate/research_students/jc3e13.page">PhD student</a> at the National Oceanography Centre Southampton and the University of Southampton. My research focus is on understanding small scale physical processes in the ocean, including internal waves, stirring and turbulence. I investigate these processes using in-situ observational data from several sources including ships and autonomous instruments. </p>

<a id="my-code" class="anchor" href="#my-code" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>My code</h3>

<p>I write a lot of python code for my work, and I am happy for anyone who might want to use my code to do so freely. </p>

<p>In my experience, most code written for oceanographic data analysis is in the form of messy Matlab scripts that don't easily transfer from one problem to another. I am constantly frustrated by the feeling that I am wasting my time writing something that has already been written by many people before me, but that I don't have access to. With this in mind, I try to make most of my data analysis code as general as possible and available on GitHub in a language that doesn't require expensive software to use (python). </p>

<p>Since so much oceanographic data comes in the form of vertical profiles of properties, such as temperature or salinity, as a function of pressure, a large portion of my code is written to analyse this form of data. I assume that it is only of interest to other oceanographers. Nevertheless, I have attempted to keep it in an order that future me will understand and I hope that it is also clear to others too.</p>
