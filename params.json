{"name":"Jesse Cusack","tagline":"","body":"### About me\r\n\r\nI'm a PhD student at the National Oceanography Centre Southampton and the University of Southampton. My research focus is on understanding small scale physical processes in the ocean, including internal waves, stirring and turbulence. I investigate these processes using in-situ observational data from several sources including ships and autonomous instruments. \r\n\r\n### My code\r\n\r\nI write a lot of python code for my work, and I am happy for anyone who might want to use my code to do so freely. \r\n\r\nIn my experience, most code written for oceanographic data analysis is in the form of messy Matlab scripts that don't easily transfer from one problem to another. I am constantly frustrated by the feeling that I am wasting my time writing something that has already been written by many people before me, but that I don't have access to. With this in mind, I try to make most of my data analysis code as general as possible and available on GitHub in a language that doesn't require expensive software to use (python). \r\n\r\nSince so much oceanographic data comes in the form of vertical profiles of properties, such as temperature or salinity, as a function of pressure, a large portion of my code is written to analyse this form of data. I assume that it is only of interest to other oceanographers. Nevertheless, I have attempted to keep it in an order that future me will understand and I hope that it is also clear to others too.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
