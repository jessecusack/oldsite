		<p>
			I write a lot of python code for my work, and I am happy for anyone who might want to use my code to do so freely.
		</p>
		<p>
			In my experience, most code written for oceanographic data analysis is in the form of messy Matlab scripts that don't easily transfer from one problem to another. I am constantly frustrated by the feeling that I am wasting my time writing something that has already been written by many people before me, but that I don't have access to. With this in mind, I try to make most of my data analysis code as general as possible and available on GitHub in a language that doesn't require expensive software to use (python).
		</p>
		<p>
			Since so much oceanographic data comes in the form of vertical profiles of properties, such as temperature or salinity, as a function of pressure, a large portion of my code is written to analyse this form of data. I assume that it is only of interest to other oceanographers. Nevertheless, I have attempted to keep it in an order that future me will understand and I hope that it is also clear to others too.
